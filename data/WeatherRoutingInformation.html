    <hr>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The Weather Routing Plugin is designed to
compute iteratively positions the boat could possibly make at
a certain time.  By merging the results of many calculations,
it is possible to form a map determining the best route
to any given location within the map.

<h3>Quick Start</h3>
First, load the grib file used for routing using the grib plugin.  Next, open the Weather Routing plugin from the main toolbar and right click the map and Select "Weather Route Position" at the starting location.  Repeat this step for the destination.  Now, in the Weather Routing window from the Configuration menu (next to File) Select "New".  From here you must configure your vessel correctly in the boat dialog.  When ready, select "Compute" from the Configuration menu to compute the weather route.

<h3>Warning</h3>
As of June 5, 2014, the algorithm exhibits a few flaws which can result in accidental back-tracking.
This greatly increases computation time, and usually only occurs with currents or near many islands.

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Integration with the grib plugin (versioin 2.1 or later) allows for
knowledge of weather conditions.  The climatology plugin can also
provide a source of data for longer voyages, but be warned that using
the climatology data, especially in variable wind areas is unlikely
to give realistic results.  Using climatology for currents is more useful
and can be used with grib wind data when grib current data is not available.
<br>
For example, in the case where data is valid from both sources,
grib will always be choosen.  If current data is available from climatology,
and only wind from grib, then the grib wind is used with the climatology current.

<p>The grib time selected on the timeline at the time the computation is
started can be syncronized.  From there, the grib timeline data is accessed
as the computation proceeds.  Once a computation is completed, the
course and position of the boat as it sails along the computed route
can be viewed during grib playback.

<p>Wind data is required; if no Current or Swell data is available, they are assumed to be zero.

<h3>Configuration Options</h3>

<p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Time Step</b> Time to sail before considering a course or sail change.  This is the difference between the isochrons on the map.  Generally the routes become faster with smaller time steps, so you can determine if the timestep is sufficient if doubling it gives a route very nearly as fast.</li>
  <li><b>Grib</b> Enable using current grib from grib plugin.</li>
  <li><b>Climatology</b> <ul>
      <li><b>Disable</b> Do not allow climatology to be used.</li>
      <li><b>Currents Only</b> Use climatology for currents, but never wind.</li>
      <li><b>Cumulative Map</b> Pretend the wind comes from all of the directions in the wind atlas
        for the percentage of time based on the atlas.  For this mode to work optimally, you should sail
      at all angles from 0 to 360, and check "optimize tacking" in the vmg tab of the boat dialog.  This will
      allow the program to assume you will tack as needed in intervals shorter than the isochrons to take advantage of wind shifts.</li>
      <li><b>Cumulative - Calms</b> Like Cumulative Map, except the boat also drifts without sailing during calms.</li>
      <li><b>Most Likely</b> Use the interpolated most likely wind data from the wind atlas, with the most likely wind speed.</li>
      <li><b>Average</b> Use wind vector average for wind direction, and wind magnitude average for wind speed.  This
    is the fastest to compute, but not very realistic (it may be close in prevailing conditions).</li></ul>
  <li><b>Allow Data Deficient</b> Continue to navigate on last valid wind data
    even if there is no more valid wind data in the area/time.</li>
  <li><b>Integrator</b> Newton's method is default and fastest, but doesn't take into account changes
    in wind/current along each step.  Rutta Kunge (4th order) is much more accurate taking 4 samples, but a lot slower.</li>
  <li><b>Detect Land</b> Use GSHHS coastline data to avoid sailing through land.  This check is quite slow and should be optimized in the future.  It is recommended to upgrade to the high resolution background map <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/chart_sources">available here</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Inverted Regions</b> This is relatively rare, but in some cases it may be
    possible to reach a location from two different routes (imagine either side of an island)
    which is further away from the destination before the destination can be reached.  At this
    point, the algorithm must invert and work inwards on this inverted region (rather than outwards)
    to possibly reach the destination.  This case can occur when routing around islands,
    or occasionally when routing near a high pressure system. Normally this should be disabled,
    and extra computations are avoided.  NOTE: this mode has bugs</li>
  <li><b>Anchoring</b>  In some cases, it may be preferable to anchor (assuming it
    isn't too deep) rather than continue to navigate if there is a contrary current which
    is swifter than the boat can travel.  This allows the route to reach the destination sooner
    by sitting in place until the current abades.</li>
  <li><b>Max Diverted Course</b> Maximum course error to continue toward destination.  Not all possible courses will be considered and therefore the most optimal route may not be found.  This usually (but not in all cases) is obvious when the optimal route is sometimes near the edge of the graph.  Using a reasonable value can greatly speeds the rate of computation.</li>
  <li><b>Max Search Angle</b> Like Max Diverted Course, except the search range is based from the starting position to the destination.</li>
  <li><b>Max Wind Knots</b> Do not navigate in areas with more wind than this value.</li>
  <li><b>Max Swell Meters</b> Do not attempt to navigate in areas with more wave average height than this value.</li>
  <li><b>Max Latitude</b> Do not navigate above (or below in the southern hemisphere) this latitude.</li>
  <li><b>Max # of Tacks</b> Does not attempt to tack more than this number of times.  Currently it tacks as much as it likes initially, then stops tacking at the limit, therefore if a very low number or an even/odd mis-match is given, a very sub-optimal track may be produced.  For this reason a value of -1 (unlimited tacks) is recomended</li>
  <li><b>Tacking Time</b> Penalty for course change from one tack to the other in seconds.  This is normally irrelevant for ocean passages, but could be useful for routes in tight quarters  Setting to 0 avoids extra calculations. </li>
  <li><b>Wind VS Current</b> When wind opposes current rough seas can be produced.  This constraint takes the dot product of the current and wind vectors, and if the result exceeds this value, navigation in this area is avoided.  Eg, a value of 20 would avoid 10 knots of wind opposes a 2 knot current.  Higher values allow for rougher conditions; the special value 0 (default) allows any conditions.
  <li><b>Avoid Cyclone Tracks</b> Uses climatology cyclone tracks to avoid routings which cross historic cyclones.  The settings in the climatology configuration for windspeed, pressure elnino etc are used, so only visible tracks are considered.</li>
  <li><b>Courses (relative to true wind)</b> A list of courses to attempt sailing.  Excluding certain values can force the route to explicity show tacks/jibes.  Another option is to remove all upwind values to find a course which is always running off the wind (even if it is much longer.)  Good results typically have a course every 3-5 degrees; more steps takes longer computation time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Batch Mode</h3>
<p>Once a weather route is successfully computed, it is possible to determine the best time to leave.  To do this, many configurations must be generated each with a different start time.  Starting by selecting a single configuration with the earliest starting time.  From the configuration menu, select batch (ctrl+b) From here, enter the number of days/hours to generate spans.  Using decimal values for hours is allowed (ie: 0.5 for half-hour)  Once generate is selected, many configurations should appear.  Now, "Compute All (ctrl+a)" can be selected from the configurations menu.  A total progress bar can be seen under the configurations.  Finally a report describing the routes is available from the View menu.

<h3>Boat</h3>

<p>
The boat dialog displays the polar plot of the boat's speed vs true wind direction as well as showing other details.  An xml file specifies the boat parameters and each sail plan.  Two file types of polars are supported; CSV (same as qtVlm) and xml parameters which describe how to compute the polar.

<p>
The VMG tab shows the best courses for up and down wind on each tack.  Optimize Tacking makes the polar reflect these tacking options on the relevant courses.  If this option is chosen, then the boat will assume the ability to sail in these angles (it is assumed the captain will tack periodically to maintain any course.)  If tacking is not optimized, then weather routing will tack only at the isochrons, resulting in overlapping alternate routes, and potentially slightly less optimal course (but will specifically display where to tack.)  It also may take significantly longer to compute courses in areas with rugged coastlines.

<p>Most users should measure their boat performance (speed at each wind speed and direction relative to true wind) and load a CSV polar file of these records instead of computing them automatically.  In the future, the computations could be greatly improved with more parameters to yield more accurate results.

<p>
It is also possible to compute boat polar from an augmented sailboat transform calculation.
The original sailboat transform:
<pre>
                                2
                  /  sin(A/2)  \
   sin(W) sin(A) |  ----------  | = VW eta
                  \ sin(W - A) /

W is true wind angle
A is apparent Wind angle
VW is true wind speed
eta is a boat specific constant specifying it's sailing efficiency.
</pre>
<p>Solving for boat speed based on apparent wind we get:
<pre>
                    __
              A    /VA
VB(t) =  sin (-)  /---
t->inf        2 \/ eta
</pre>
<p>
This computation is very useful for the standard rig, but doesn't really apply correctly in many cases.  It also doesn't really factor in a huge range of variables as there is only one constant.

<p>I have augmented the sailboat transform to also take into account two types of drag in the hope that it may come closer to resembling the sailing characteristics of more vessels.  This way hull speed is properly taken into account, and for boats with planing ability, you may get the right result if the correct values are used.

<p>The Frictional drag reduces the maximum speed based on the square of its speed.  The Wake drag component uses a complex math formula to compute the energy lost creating a wake:
<pre>
                                       2
           /      sin(Pi - F^-2)      \
   Drag = |  -----------------------   |
           \ (Pi - F^-2) (1 + Pi F^2) /

              ___
    V = F * \/g l

    F = sqrt(g * l) / V;

    g = 9.8 (gravity constant)
    l is length of vessel in meters
    V is meters per second

    Reaches a peak at F=Pi^-.5 which is about .56

    The huge increase starts at F = .4  (normal hull speed setting)
    
    Also interesting to note that at 80% of normal hull speed, the wave
    drag is zero as well, but the first hump occurs from .32 to .4, and
    therefore causes more drag than right at .4.

    In theory, this equation is correct for wave drag for all speeds, from displacement to planing mode.
</pre>

<p>The basic polar describing boat speed at various wind settings fails on many fronts.
First of all, various sail combinations become impractical in certain sea states,
even if the actual wind speed is the same.  The boat also does not sail the same
speed in these cases, so the actual boat speed may widely vary with identical wind
speed/direction values in different sea states.   Secondly, the wind is 3 dimensional,
and near land often has a noticable vertical component not accounted for.
Thirdly, there may be certain areas conditions, or times when the user may
selectively want to use a different polar diagram
(sail plan, navigating in fog or near ice, night vs day, autopilot vs wind vane)
Fourthly, the actual speed of the boat may change due to various parameters besides
currents, wind, and sea state. (more on this below)  There are many more reasons as well.

<p>There is also extension for the possibility of other sources of propulsion
besides wind power (namely PV-solar electric, and/or human power both which I use for
navigation when wind is unavailable) These are normally used in conjunction with sails.
This form of power falls into the category of weather routing as it is dependent on solar radiation
for photovoltaics, and temperature (sculling a yacht in tropical heat has less range than
in cooler weather).  It may be possible to consider storing generated electrical power
(one possible case would be charging batteries with a hydro tow generator sailing in strong winds,
this energy is then to be used the next day when the calm sets in) in an electric drive it is possible
to reach the final destination at a sooner time than without this consideration.
(all of this is mostly still unimplemented)

<p>It is also possible to factor slow changing, but important changes to the boat's
passage-making ability over the course of the voyage.  One example is bottom growth,
and the rate it might grow given the sailing course and various parameters.  This
would enable you to gauge how essential it is to actually paint a bottom, or if
you don't mind (as I have done many times) to clean your bottom in the middle
of the ocean, you could calculate how much time it would save (hopefully more
than the time spent scraping the growth off).  There is also the case of sails losing shape, and
becoming less efficient over the course of a very long passage.

<p>Todo list:
<ul>
<li>Optimize land detection
<li>Fix issues with the backtrack optimization so it can be used
<li>Make segment intersection test smarter and thus avoid deleting points in almost all cases

<li>Optimize ll_gc_ll
<li>Optimize climatology wind atlas
<li>implement depth and overhead height from vector charts
<li>Improve boat polar computation
<li>Fix merdian problem, so we split the world on the opposite of end longitude, and don't propagate past it
<li>Determine best way way to reduce excessive propagations at the edge of graph
<li>Fix inverted region anomallies
</ul>
