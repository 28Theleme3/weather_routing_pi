    <h3><u>Introduction</u></h3>

<p>The Weather Routing Plugin is designed to
compute iteratively positions the boat could possibly make at
a certain time.  By merging the results of many calculations,
it is possible to form a map determining the best route
to any given location within the map.

<h3><u>Quick Start</u></h3>
First, load the grib file used for routing using the grib plugin.  Next, open the Weather Routing plugin from the main toolbar and right click the map and Select "Weather Route Position" at the starting location.  Repeat this step for the destination.  Now, from the Configuration menu (next to File) Select "New".  From here you must configure your vessel correctly in the boat dialog.  When ready, select "Compute" from the Configuration menu to compute the weather route.

<h3><u>Warning</u></h3>
As of July 2, 2013, the algorithm exhibits a few flaws which can result in suboptimal
routes.  Try increasing the time step and/or disabling currents to help mitigate these.

  <h3><u>Background</u></h3>

<p>Integration with the grib plugin (version 2.1 or later) allows for
knowledge of weather conditions.  The climatology plugin can also
provide a source of data for longer voyages, but be warned that using
the climatology data, especially in variable wind areas is unlikely
to give useful results.  Using climatology for currents is more useful
and can be used with grib wind data when current data is not available.
<br>
For example, in the case where data is valid from both sources,
grib will always be choosen.  If current data is available from climatology,
and only wind from grib, then the grib wind is used with the climatology current.

<p>The grib time selected on the timeline at the time the computation is
started can be syncronized.  From there, the grib timeline data is accessed
as the computation proceeds.  Once a computation is completed, the
course and position of the boat as it sails along the computed route
can be viewed during grib playback.

<p>Wind data is required; if no Current or wave height is available, they are assumed to be zero.

<p>
The Supported Options Include:
<ul>
  <li><b>Degree Step</b> Difference in degrees between courses to attempt relative to true wind.
    Less than 3 degrees between steps usually takes a long time to calculate and it is usually
    better to use a shorter time step instead.</li>
  <li><b>Time Step</b> Time to sail before considering a course or sail change.</li>
  <li><b>Integrator</b> Newton's method is default and fastest, but doesn't take into account changes
    in boat speed along each step.  Rutta Kunge is much more accurate but slower.</li>
  <li><b>Max Diverted Course</b> Maximum course error in heading from start toward target destination to attempt.
  If set to 180, the map will expand in all directions, and can be used to find multiple destinations
  from a given source.  If set less than 180, computation time can be greatly reduced
    (as it tends to take a very long time as the map expands), but not all possible courses will be considered and therefore the optimal route may not be found.</li>
  <li><b>Max Search Angle</b> Like Max Diverted Course, except the heading error is based at the current position on the graph rather than the start position.</li>
  <li><b>Max Wind Knots</b> Do not navigate in areas with more wind than this value.</li>
  <li><b>Max Swell Meters</b> Do not attempt to navigate in areas with more wave average height than this value.</li>
  <li><b>Max Latitude</b> Do not navigate above (or below in the southern hemisphere) this latitude.</li>
  <li><b>Tacking Time</b> Penalty for course change from one tack to the other in seconds.  This is normally irrelevant for ocean passages, but could be useful for routes in tight quarters  Setting to 0 avoids extra calculations. </li>
  <li><b>Max Upwind Percentage</b> Limits the total sailing course to a given percentage of the time when
    the apparent wind is forward of the beam.</li>
  <li><b>Avoid Cyclone Tracks</b> Uses climatology cyclone tracks to avoid routings which cross historic cyclones with given parameters</li>
  <li><b>Detect Land</b> Use GSHHS coastline data to avoid sailing through land.  It is recommended to upgrade to the high resolution background map <a href="http://opencpn.org/ocpn/chart_sources">available here</a></li>
  <li><b>Inverted Regions</b> This is relatively rare, but in some cases it may be
    possible to reach some location from two different routes (imagine either side of an island)
    which is further away from the destination before the destination can be reached.  At this
    point, the algorithm must invert and work inwards on this inverted region (rather than outwards)
    to possibly reach the destination.  This case can occur when routing around islands,
    or occasionally when routing near a high pressure system. If disabled this will be ignored
    and extra computations are avoided.</li>
  <li><b>Anchoring</b>  In some cases, it may be preferable to anchor (assuming it
    isn't too deep) rather than continue to navigate if there is a contrary current which
    is swifter than the boat can travel.  This allows the route to reach the destination sooner
    by sitting in place until the current abades.</li>
  <li><b>Allow Data Deficient</b> Continue to navigate on last valid wind data
    even if there is no more valid wind data in the area/time.</li>
</ul>

<H3>Boat</H3>

<p>
The boat dialog displays the polar plot of the boat's speed vs true wind direction as well as showing other details.  Two file types are supported.  CSV (same as qtVlm) and binary which is specific to this plugin.   The binary contains much more data (various sail plans etc..)

<p>
The VMG tab shows the best courses for up and down wind on each tack.  Optimize Tacking makes the polar reflect these tacking options on the relevant courses.  If this option is chosen, then the boat will assume the ability to sail in these angles (you must then tack periodically to maintain this course)  If tacking is not optimized, then weather routing will tack only at the isochrons, resulting in overlapping alternate routes, and potentially slightly less optimal course (but will specifically display where to tack)  It also may take significantly longer to compute courses in areas with rugged coastlines.  For this reason optiming tacking is recommended.

<p>Most users, should measure their boat performance (speed at each wind speed and direction relative to true wind) and load a CSV polar file of these records instead of computing them automatically.  In the future, the computations could be greatly improved with more parameters to yield more accurate results.

<p>
The boat configuration allows one to enter the parameters used to specify the performance of a boat.
Currently supported polar files are csv (same format as qtVlm) and binary files in this format
(specific only to this plugin)  These files specify sailing speed at each wind speed and wind direction.

<p>
It is also possible to compute boat polar from an augmented sailboat transform calculation.
The original sailboat transform:
<pre>
                                2
                  /  sin(A/2)  \
   sin(W) sin(A) |  ----------  | = VW eta
                  \ sin(W - A) /

W is true wind angle
A is apparent Wind angle
VW is true wind speed
eta is a boat specific constant specifying it's sailing efficiency.
</pre>
<p>Solving for boat speed based on apparent wind we get:
<pre>
                      __
                A    /VA
VB(inf) =  sin (-)  /---
                2 \/ eta
</pre>
<p>
This computation is very useful for the standard rig, but doesn't really apply correctly in many cases.  It also doesn't really factor in a huge range of variables as there is only one constant.

<p>I have augmented the sailboat transform to also take into account two types of drag in the hope that it may come closer to resembling the sailing characteristics of more vessels.  This way hull speed is properly taken into account, and for boats with planing ability, also you may get the right result if the correct values are used.

<p>The Frictional drag reduces the maximum speed based on the square of its speed.  The Wake drag component uses a complex math formula to compute the energy lost creating a wake:
<pre>
                                       2
           /      sin(Pi - F^-2)      \
   Drag = |  -----------------------   |
           \ (Pi - F^-2) (1 + Pi F^2) /

              ___
    V = F * \/g l

    F = sqrt(g * l) / V;

    g = 9.8 (gravity constant)
    l is length of vessel in meters
    V is meters per second

    Reaches a peak at F=Pi^-.5 which is about .56

    The huge increase starts at F = .4  (normal hull speed setting)
    
    Also interesting to note that at 80% of normal hull speed, the wave
    drag is zero as well, but the first hump occurs from .32 to .4, and
    therefore causes more drag than right at .4.

    In theory, this equation is correct for wave drag for all speeds, from displacement to planing mode.
</pre>

<p>The basic polar describing boat speed at various wind settings fails on many fronts.
First of all, various sail combinations become impractical in certain sea states,
even if the actual wind speed is the same.  The boat also does not sail the same
speed in these cases, so the actual boat speed may widely vary with identical wind
speed/direction values in different sea states.   Secondly, the wind is 3 dimensional,
and near land often has a noticable vertical component not accounted for.
Thirdly, there may be certain areas conditions, or times when the user may
selectively want to use a different polar diagram
(sail plan, navigating in fog or near ice, night vs day, autopilot vs wind vane)
Fourthly, the actual speed of the boat may change due to various parameters besides
currents, wind, and sea state. (more on this below)  There are many more reasons as well.

<p>There is also extension for the possibility of other sources of propulsion
besides wind power (namely PV-solar electric, and/or human power both which I use for
navigation when wind is unavailable) These are normally used in conjunction with sails.
This form of power falls into the category of weather routing as it is dependent on solar radiation
for photovoltaics, and temperature (sculling a yacht in tropical heat has less range than
in cooler weather).  It may be possible to consider storing generated electrical power
(one possible case would be charging batteries with a hydro tow generator sailing in strong winds,
this energy is then to be used the next day when the calm sets in) in an electric drive it is possible
to reach the final destination at a sooner time than without this consideration.
(all of this is mostly still unimplemented)

<p>It is also possible to factor slow changing, but important changes to the boat's
passage-making ability over the course of the voyage.  One example is bottom growth,
and the rate it might grow given the sailing course and various parameters.  This
would enable you to gauge how essential it is to actually paint a bottom, or if
you don't mind (as I have done many times) to clean your bottom in the middle
of the ocean, you could calculate how much time it would save (hopefully more
than the time spent scraping the growth off).  There is also the case of sails losing shape, and
becoming less efficient over the course of a long passage.
