    <h3><u>Introduction</u></h3>

<p>The Weather Routing Plugin is designed to
compute iteratively positions the boat could possibly make at
a certain time.  By merging the results of many calculations,
it is possible to form a map determining the quickest route
to any given location within the map.

  <h3><u>Usage</u></h3>

<p>Integration with the grib plugin (version 2.1 or later) allows for
knowledge of weather conditions.  Eventually the climatology plugin will
also provide a source of data for longer voyages.

<p>The grib time selected on the timeline at the time the computation is
started is syncronized.  From there, the grib timeline data is accessed
as the computation proceeds.  Once a computation is completed, the
course and position of the boat as it sails can be viewed during grib
playback.

<p>The Wind, Current and wave height data is read from the grib file.
If no Current or wave height is available, they are assumed to be 0.

<p>Eventually we can provide graphs for various data parameters over
the course of the optimal route.

<p>
The Supported Options Include:
<ul>
  <li><b>Degree Step</b> Difference in degrees between courses to attempt.</li>
  <li><b>Time Step</b> Time in seconds to sail before attempting course change.</li>
  <li><b>Max Diverted Course</b> Maximum course error from heading toward target destination to attempt.
  If set to 180, the map will expand in all directions, and can be used to find multiple destinations
  from a given source.  If set less than 180, computation time is reduced (as it tends to take a very long
  time as the map expands), but possible courses which take directions on a bearing too far from the closest great circle route (even if just for 1 iteration) will be lost, and therefore the optimal route may not be achieved.
    finding routes</li>
  <li><b>Max Wind Knots</b> Do not navigate in areas with more wind than this value.</li>
  <li><b>Max Swell Meters</b> Do not attempt to navigate in areas with more wave average height than this value.</li>
  <li><b>Max Latitude</b> Do not navigate above (or below) this latitude.</li>
  <li><b>Tacking Time</b> Penalty for course change from one tack to the other in seconds.  This is normally irrelevant except for very close isochrons.  Setting to 0 avoids these calculations.  </li>
  <li><b>Substeps</b> In areas where we frequently encounter land collisions, it is possible to generate
        a more refined map in smaller time steps to find routes, then merge these substeps at each
        full step</li>
  <li><b>Detect Land</b> Use coastline data to avoid sailing through land</li>
  <li><b>Inverted Regons</b> This is relatively rare, but in some cases it may be
    possible to reach a destination further away sooner than a closer one.  In
    cases where there are multiple routes to reach this further destination which
    travel on different sides of a region that cannot yet be reached, an inversion
    occurs.  The program must work inwards on this inverted region to reach a
    possible goal, if disabled these areas will be ignored.</li>
  <li><b>Anchoring</b>  In some cases, it may be preferable to anchor (assuming it
    isn't too deep) rather than navigate if going against a swift current as you
    may actually reach the destination sooner if holding still until the current abades.</li>
  <li><b>Allow Data Deficient</b> Continue to navigate on last valid wind data
    even if there is no more valid wind data in the area/time.</li>
</ul>

<H3>Boat</H3>

<p>
The boat dialog displays the polar plot of the boat's speed vs true wind direction as well as showing other details.  Two file types are supported.  CSV (same as qtVlm) and binary which is specific to this plugin.   The binary contains much more data.

<p>
The VMG tab shows the best courses for up and down wind on each tack.  Optimize Tacking makes the polar reflect these tacking options on the relevant courses.  If tacking is not optimized, then weather routing will perform optimal tacking at isochrons, but will not be able to take advantage of courses which spend more than one time on a tack than another as well because the resolution is limited to the isochron period.

The boat configuration allows one to enter the parameters used to specify the performance of a boat.
Currently supported polar files are csv (same format as qtVlm) and binary files in this format
(specific only to this plugin)  These files specify sailing speed at each wind speed and wind direction.

<p>
It is also possible to compute boat polar from an augmented sailboat transform calculation.
The original sailboat transform:
<pre>
                                2
                  /  sin(A/2)  \
   sin(W) sin(A) |  ----------  | = VW eta
                  \ sin(W - A) /

W is true wind angle
A is apparent Wind angle
VW is true wind speed
eta is a boat specific constant specifying it's sailing efficiency.
</pre>
<p>
This computation is very useful for the standard rig, but doesn't really apply correctly in many cases.  It also doesn't really factor in a huge range of variables as there is only one constant.

<p>I have augmented the sailboat transform to add a few more parameters in the hope that
it may come closer to resembling the sailing characteristics of more vessels.

<p>For many users, it may be best to enter measured values for the boat in csv format rather
than attempt to compute. Eventually it may even be possible to use the plugin to obtain
the polar values from gps during passage (given enough wind states).  It may also be eventually
supported to overlay the obtained data with the transform calculation to better optimize the
coefficents used to calculate it.

<p>The basic polar describing boat speed at various wind settings fails on many fronts.
First of all, various sail combinations become impractical in certain sea states,
even if the actual wind speed is the same.  The boat also does not sail the same
speed in these cases, so the actual boat speed may widely vary with identical wind
speed/direction values in different conditions.   Secondly, the wind is 3 dimensional,
and near land often has a strong vertical component.  Thirdly, there may be certain
areas conditions, or times when the user may selectively want to essentially use
a different polar diagram (sail plan, navigating in fog or near ice, night vs day,
autopilot vs wind vane)  Fourthly, the actual speed of the boat may change due
to various parameters besides currents, wind, and sea state for various reasons
(more on this below)  Fifthly.. wait I have like 10 of these I'll stop now.

<p>There is also extension for the possibility of other sources of propulsion
besides wind power (namely PV-solar electric) which  may be
used in conjunction with sails.  This form of power falls into the category of weather
routing as it is dependent on solar radiation.  Finally, it may be possible to store
some of this radiation, (during day with sun and wind) or in the case of anchoring in
an adverse tidal flow with a hydro generator in the form of chemical energy to be used
later (at night or when the tide is right) in an electric drive to reach the final destination
at a sooner possible time than any other method employed.
(all of this is mostly still unimplemented, but there is some c++)

<p>It is also possible to factor slow changing, but important changes to the boat's
passage-making ability over the course of the voyage.  One example is bottom growth,
and the rate it might grow given the sailing course and various parameters.  This
would enable you to gauge how essential it is to actually paint a bottom, or if
you don't mind (as I have done) to dive and scrape mid-ocean every week or two,
you might be able to actually determine how much time it would save (usually more
than the time spent swimming).  There is also the case of sails losing shape, and
becoming less efficient over the course of a long upwind passage.
